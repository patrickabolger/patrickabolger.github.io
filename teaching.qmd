## Teaching Philosophy

We should foster learning through student-centred teaching, where the instructor acts more as a mentor and facilitator than as a lecturer. In my opinion, the best learning, be it at the undergraduate or graduate level, takes place through active learning as students work on projects tailored to their own interests. 

That said, it has been a challenge to implement this kind of learning in the large modules (*courses* in the US and Canada) that I have often taught (i.e., 100-300 students). Nonetheless, it was fairly easy to do in the lab sections of my statistics modules at Texas A&M. In small groups, my students would develop their own surveys in Google Forms, collect data, and then analyse it for their individual [IMRaD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMRAD) papers (see <a href="https://patrickabolger.github.io/PSYC-301-Syllabus-Spring-2022/#tasks-in-lab" target="_blank">here</a> for a description of the labs in my most recent syllabus for that module). Student-centred learning is also difficult to implement in statistics modules in general, where students often need explicit instructor help in order to understand the material. But carefully planned small-group projects go a long way in centring the student in the module.

## Teaching Experience

I have a good deal of experience teaching various subjects, but what energizes me most nowadays is teaching statistics and research methods in higher education. As you can see from my formal education, I did not take the direct route to this point.

### Monterey Institute

After getting my MA in TESOL from the Monterey (now Middlebury) Institute of International Studies in 1997, I began teaching English in an ESL context. It didn't take long before I was frequently being tapped to teach advanced grammar and academic writing.

### University of Arizona

This continued while I was a PhD student a few, short years later. I often taught Freshman Composition to support myself as an interdisciplinary PhD student of applied psycholinguistics at the University of Arizona.

### University of Alberta

After obtaining my PhD, I was hired in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Alberta. I usually taught modules related to my PhD expertise (e.g., *Psychology of Language*, *Introduction to Linguistics*, *Child Language Acquisition*).

But I was also heavily engaged in research at the time, learning a great deal not only about new research methodologies, but also about more modern approaches to statistical analysis, like mixed-effects modeling. This became important to my teaching later.

At the same time, I was mentoring many, many graduate and undergraduate students in how to design and run behavioural, eyetracking and ERP experiments.

After seven years at the University of Alberta, I resigned in 2012 in order to take care of a family member in desperate need. Since academia is far too competitive to be able to accommodate cases like mine, that career hiatus ultimately spelled the end of my research trajectory

### Texas A&M University

In 2016 I was hired as an Instructional Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at Texas A&M University. There, the vast majority of my responsibilities comprised teaching undergraduate statistics (<a href="https://patrickabolger.github.io/PSYC-301-Syllabus-Spring-2022/" target="_blank">Elementary Statistics for Psychology</a>), graduate statistics (<a href="https://patrickabolger.github.io/PSYC-652-Fall-2020/" target="_blank">Statistics and Research Methods in Industrial/Organizational Psychology (I and II)</a>), and undergraduate research methods (*Research Methods and Design in Psychology*, <a href="https://patrickabolger.github.io/PSYC-245-Spring-2022/" target="_blank">Introduction to Psychological Science Methods</a>). But I also taught *Developmental Psychology* and *Psychology of Language*.

To be honest, I was rather surprised at how enthusiastic I became in teaching statistics and research methods. The module I taught most frequently, by far, was *Elementary Statistics for Psychology*, a large module (usually about 100 students each), with multiple labs that also required that each student write an IMRaD paper. It was here that I implemented most of my innovations, including most notably, the following:

#### Open educational resources

I incorporated exclusively open educational resources into the module. Doing so reduces the financial burden on students, thereby helping not only to reduce their overall stress levels, but also (by extension) to maximize their learning potential. Specifically, I did the following:

- assigned a free, high-quality textbook, [learning statistics with jamovi](https://davidfoxcroft.github.io/lsj-book/)  
- had them use the free statistical software, [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/), for analyses  
- wrote a new <a href="https://patrickabolger.github.io/ElemStatsLabManual/" target="_blank">lab manual</a> for the module (since the other manual in use was designed for SPSS)

#### Reducing student anxiety

I transferred the mathematical calculations traditionally required on exams to for-credit, but repeatable homework assignments. This involved setting up math-based problems using the [exams](https://www.r-exams.org/) package in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). Some of those assignments can be found [here](https://github.com/patrickabolger/stats-exam-questions).
