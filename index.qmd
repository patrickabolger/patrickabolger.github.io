I currently work as a Senior Lecturer in Psychology at Nottingham Trent University, where I have taught various modules, including the following:

- *Developing Academic Skills in Psychology* (year 1)
- *Introduction to Developmental Psychology* (year 1; module leader)
- *Research Methods & Stats* (years 1 and year 2)
- *Social & Developmental Psychology* (year 2)
- *Psychology of the Family* (year 3; module leader)
- Final-year projects (year 3)
- *The Child in Context* (Masters)
- *Developmental Profiles of Language and Learning* (Masters)

I am part of the [Language, Literacy, and Psycholinguistics Research Group](https://www.ntu.ac.uk/research/groups-and-centres/groups/language-literacy-and-psycholinguistics).

My research interests are as follows:

- psycholinguistics (bilingualism, skilled reading)  
- diversity, equity, and inclusion in the unrelated areas of open-source software development and the teaching of statistics  
- the incorporation of large language models into educational contexts, especially writing and statistics  

<!-- ## UofN -->

<!-- **University of Nottingham** (August 2022 - January 2024) -->

<!-- For a year and a half, I was a *Community Development Champion* in the [School of Psychology](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/psychology/welcome-to-psychology.aspx) at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/). I worked exclusively with the team at [Open Science Tools](https://opensciencetools.org/) (the makers of both [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org/), the open-source software for psychological experiments, and its online sister, [Pavlovia](https://pavlovia.org/docs/home/about)). I was hired through funding from an [Essential Open Source Software for Science](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/) grant from the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/), obtained by the fun, friendly, upstanding team at PsychoPy. -->

<!-- The first project I carried out was designing a survey in *Pavlovia* that was sent out both to members of the *PsychoPy* user forum and to researchers who had frequently cited *PsychoPy* in their publications. Here are the [results](https://psychopy.github.io/psychopy-edi-survey/). -->

<!-- I also organised various workshops and codesprints. One kind of workshop that I ran myself was the 3-hour [translator workshops](https://workshops.psychopy.org/translators/index.html). -->
